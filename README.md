# SRT-TIMESTAMP-REMOVER
To read subtitles before watching a movie, it's a good idea to clear them of unnecessary timestamps beforehand. For example, for *. str subtitles, you can write a simple JavaScript script.
Removes lines that start with numbers, as well as unnecessary line breaks. Sometimes these are semantic lines, but usually they are rare.

Save the code to a file with a .html extension and run it in a browser, for example, Opera. An example of how to execute the script is shown in the figure.
ON-LINE version (attention, the execution of the script may take a long time (several tens of seconds)), the browser may ask whether to proceed with the execution of the scripts.
